  GRID provides a system for the unique identification of "Releases" of
  music over electronic networks, so that they can be managed efficiently.
  A Release is defined precisely in the Standard but can be understood as a
  collection of recordings or other media that are grouped together for commerce.

<p>
  As an Independent Artist you may not have a GRID. Mark as N/A if
  there is no GRID.
